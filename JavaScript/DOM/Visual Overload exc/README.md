Reservations
===
- Use an input element to get the name, and put all your logic in a checkReservation function.

 The function should be invoked when you click a button:

- If the reservation exists and is unclaimed, welcome the user.
- If the reservation exists and is already claimed, inform the user about the situation
- If there is no reservation, tell the user there is nothing under their name

Use ‘Bob’ and ‘Ted’ to test your code:
- When you test Bob, it should say “Welcome, Bob”
- When you test Ted, it should say “Hmm, someone already claimed this reservation”
- If you try a different name, it should say “You have no reservation”
